Looking back at where we started, Hackerspace has grown hundred-fold, and with growth comes change. Hackerspace is now HSP, and this is our new identity.

While the identity is new, the aim, goal and promises to our members and community remain the same: To build and foster a community of members interested in FOSS, and to spread knowledge among our peers.
