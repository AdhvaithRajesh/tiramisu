# [Homebrew FOSS by HackerSpace PESUECC](https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz/)

April 2022

**What was the idea behind Homebrew?**<br>

Homebrew is a gathering place for FOSS enthusiasts on campus. It was created with the idea to solve the absence of a major FOSS Community in PES. It serves as a hub where enthusiasts engage in conversations about their preferred open source technologies, share alternatives, and propose different software options. <br>

Additionally, the platform hosts the "Homebrew Expo" on a weekly basis, offering students a platform to showcase their projects, mirroring the spirit of the actual Homebrew community.<br>

Having been in existence for nearly a year, Homebrew has established itself as a valuable platform for sharing thoughts, ideas, and guides related to emerging technologies. Members of the community contribute their insights to assist and guide other individuals seeking information.

Here are a few [blogs and guides](https://sharp-wright-d62960.netlify.app/blog/) written by some of the members of HackerSpace PESU-ECC.

Our members have also had the amazing oppurtunity to speak at some of **FOSS United Bangalore's** meetups
