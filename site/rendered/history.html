<p>April 2022</p>
<p><strong>What was the idea behind Homebrew?</strong><br></p>
<p>Homebrew is a gathering place for FOSS enthusiasts on campus. It was created with the idea to solve the absence of a major FOSS Community in PES. It serves as a hub where enthusiasts engage in conversations about their preferred open source technologies, share alternatives, and propose different software options. <br></p>
<p>Additionally, the platform hosts the &quot;Homebrew Expo&quot; on a weekly basis, offering students a platform to showcase their projects, mirroring the spirit of the actual Homebrew community.<br></p>
<p>Having been in existence for nearly a year, Homebrew has established itself as a valuable platform for sharing thoughts, ideas, and guides related to emerging technologies. Members of the community contribute their insights to assist and guide other individuals seeking information.</p>
<p>Here are a few <a href="https://sharp-wright-d62960.netlify.app/blog/">blogs and guides</a> written by some of the members of HackerSpace PESU-ECC.</p>
<p>Our members have also had the amazing oppurtunity to speak at some of <strong>FOSS United Bangalore's</strong> meetups
