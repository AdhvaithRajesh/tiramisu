            <p>Have you ever wondered what the World Wide Web and Fortran have in common? Other than being pioneering innovations, they happen to stem from the cerebrums of tinkering individuals who also have the Turing Award in common. The ACM A. M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to computer science. It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and is colloquially known as or often referred to as the &quot;Nobel Prize of Computing&quot;.</p>
<p>The award is named after Alan Turing, who was a British mathematician and is often credited as being the key founder of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. The first recipient, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, of Carnegie Mellon University. The first female recipient was Frances E. Allen of IBM in 2006. The latest recipient, in 2021, is Jack Dongarra, of the University of Tennessee.</p>
<p>Every Turing recipient is expected to present a Turing lecture on a topic of their choice at a forum of their choice. This highly anticipated lecture is often videotaped in its entirety and available for viewing in the ACM Digital Library. The lecture is often included in the Proceedings of the conference at which it was presented, also available in the ACM Digital Library. The video and lecture will also be uploaded to the Turing website (A.M. Turing Award), which presents a rich collection of Turing information, including citations, bibliographic material, videos, lectures, photos, and more.</p>
<p>ACM is The Association for Computing Machinery is a US-based international learned society for computing. It was founded in 1947 and is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society. It is a non-profit professional membership group, and their aim is to highlight the significant impact of the contributions of the Turing Laureates on computing and society, to look ahead to the future of technology and innovation, and to help inspire the next generation of computer scientists to invent and dream.</p>
<p>Let's look into the honorary awardees and their contributions to the field of Computer Science:</p>
