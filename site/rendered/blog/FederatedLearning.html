<p>Federated Learning is an approach to train the machine learning models across multiple decentralized devices or servers that hold local data samples. Instead of sharing sensitive data, what each device does is - it trains a model locally and only shares the learned parameters (like gradients or weights) with a central server. This ensures data privacy and efficient model training across a distributed network.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Federated Learning was first introduced by Google in 2016 to improve the predictive text on smartphones without compromising user privacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In today's digital age, data privacy is more important than ever. With massive amounts of data generated daily, ensuring that personal information remains confidential is crucial. Federated Learning addresses this need by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data.</p>
<h2 id="how-federated-learning-works">How Federated Learning Works <a class="anchor" href="#how-federated-learning-works">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Devices:</strong> Train the model using local data, ensuring that sensitive information remains on the device.</li>
<li><strong>Central Server:</strong> Aggregates updates without accessing local data, combining the knowledge from each device to improve the overall model.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Protocols:</strong> Ensure secure transmission of updates, preventing any leakage of sensitive information during the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's break down the process:</p>
<p>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. SO, let us now explore the detailed mechanics and the rationale behind each step involved in FL.<br>
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230717153929/Federated-Learning-(1).png" alt="Federated Learning Diagram"></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Model Initialization</strong>:
A global model is initialized on the central server. This model is typically a neural network with a defined architecture but with untrained weights.The global model is created based on the desired task. Finally in this stage, the server then distributes this model to all participating devices, ensuring each device starts with the same initial parameters.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Initialize the global model
global_model = initialize_model()
# Distribute the global model to all devices
for device in devices:
    send_model_to_device(global_model, device)
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Local Training</strong>:
Each device trains the model on its local dataset. This step allows the model to learn from the data available on the device.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Local training function
def train_locally(model, data):
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(local_epochs):
        for batch in data:
            # Forward pass
            predictions = model.forward(batch.inputs)
            # Compute loss
            loss = compute_loss(predictions, batch.labels)
            # Backward pass and update weights
            model.backward(loss)
            model.update_weights()
    return model.get_weights()

# Train model locally on each device
local_updates = []
for device in devices:
    local_data = load_data(device)
    local_weights = train_locally(global_model, local_data)
    local_updates.append(local_weights)
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Model Updates</strong>:
Devices send their model updates (typically the gradients or weight changes) to the central server instead of the raw data. The updates contain only the changes in the model's weights, which are much smaller in size compared to the raw data. This step ensures data privacy and reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Send local model updates to the central server
for update in local_updates:
    send_update_to_server(update)
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Aggregation</strong>:
The central server aggregates the received updates using techniques like Federated Averaging to create an improved global model. Federated Averaging (FedAvg): This is the most common aggregation method where the server averages the weights from all the updates. Averaging the weights is effective because it combines the learning from diverse data distributions across devices, leading to a more generalized model.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Federated Averaging function
def federated_averaging(global_model, local_updates):
    num_devices = len(local_updates)
    new_weights = [0] * len(global_model.weights)

    for update in local_updates:
        for i, weight in enumerate(update):
            new_weights[i] += weight / num_devices

    global_model.set_weights(new_weights)
    return global_model

# Aggregate the local updates to update the global model
global_model = federated_averaging(global_model, local_updates)
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Iteration</strong>:
Steps 2-4 are repeated for multiple rounds until the model converges or reaches the desired level of accuracy. Iterative training allows the model to improve incrementally, benefiting from new data and continual learning. Each round of training and aggregation reduces the global model's loss, gradually enhancing its performance.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Main federated learning loop
def federated_learning(server_model, devices, num_rounds):
    for round in range(num_rounds):
        local_updates = []
        for device in devices:
            local_model = train_locally(server_model, device.data)
            local_updates.append(local_model.get_weights())
        server_model = federated_averaging(server_model, local_updates)
    return server_model

# Execute the federated learning process
global_model = federated_learning(global_model, devices, num_rounds)
</code></pre>

</figure>
<p>This is a common algorithm that is used in Federated Learning. The updates from each device are averaged to update the global model, ensuring that each device contributes to the learning process. But why does this averaging work and what does it actually do?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Linear Combination of Functions</strong>:
The weights of a neural network can be seen as coefficients of a very high-dimensional function. By averaging the weights, we effectively create a new function that is a linear combination of the individual functions trained on each device's data. This linear combination often captures the general trend of the data distribution better than any single model trained on local data.</li>
<li><strong>Convergence and Stability</strong>:
Averaging helps in smoothing out the noise in the gradient updates. Each device's data might have some noise, but when averaged across many devices, the noise tends to cancel out, leading to more stable and reliable updates. This is particularly important in non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) settings, where data distributions can vary significantly across devices.</li>
<li><strong>Generalization</strong>:
By aggregating updates from multiple devices, the global model is exposed to a more diverse set of data points, which improves its ability to generalize to unseen data. This diversity helps in creating a more robust model that performs well across different data distributions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a sample pseudo-code for Federated Averaging:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Sample pseudo-code for Federated Averaging
def federated_averaging(global_model, local_updates):
    num_devices = len(local_updates)
    new_weights = [0] * len(global_model.weights)

    for update in local_updates:
        for i, weight in enumerate(update.weights):
            new_weights[i] += weight / num_devices

    global_model.set_weights(new_weights)
    return global_model
